          Welcome to my personal website. Here you can find links to all the things I've been up to.

          <b>About me:</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have recently graduted from the five-year architecture program at the University of Notre Dame. I've developed a passion for historic buildings that I have been able to explore in my concentration of Historic Preservation and Restoration. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to doing architecture, I've spent a lot of my time pursuing music. I played trumpet in the Notre Dame Marching Band as well as various other ensembles. I also developed a love of theatre through my time as tech crew in high school, and it is something I enjoyed through my time as a stagehand at the DeBartolo Performing Art Center and watching local and professional shows. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy reading, sketching, knitting, and going on research rabbit holes of historic events. So many hobbies and not nearly enough time to do them all.
